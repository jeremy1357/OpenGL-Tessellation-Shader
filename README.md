# OpenGL-Tessellation-Shader
This shader is **based off the tutorial located** at **http://ogldev.atspace.co.uk/www/tutorial30/tutorial30.html**
Not many up to date examples are easily found so feel free to use this with the tutorial linked. You will 
likely have to change the attribute/uniform names to fit your program.
